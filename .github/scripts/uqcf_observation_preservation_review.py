This is the occupied-support receiver-preservation extension and corrections, not certification of the full observation_effect draft or its scratch numeric counts.\nVerify E's predual structure for arbitrary finite conditional expectations, support projection K, coarse central projections Q_r, and full-support test state tau_r. Independently prove necessity and sufficiency of (I-Q_r)L_j K_r=0 for all-input record-weight preservation after E Phi E. Challenge Kraus-representation independence, channel trace preservation, positivity, coarse groupings, faithfulness and restricted preparability. Reconstruct unitary and faithful reductions and the explicit nonfaithful control.\nVerify P2 owner-section specialization PTI=id and column support criterion; distinguish proper from identity contraction, fixed from changing carrier, and coarse receiver groupings. No physical readout or actual motion is inferred.\nAdjudicate the exact correction to Grok Theorem 4(c): existence of record-fixing but nonnormalizing unitaries iff some block has both n_k>=2 and m_k>=2. Check scalar multiplicity counterexample and controlled-unitary construction for every claimed dimension. If flawed, provide a concrete counterexample.\nCheck the all-input versus actual-state correction with Hadamard and I/2, and nonselective idempotence versus actual selective events. Does the text claim a new strict event on repetition, a collapse law or a physical clock? It must not. Preserve user's atemporal measurement interpretation without declaring an outcome mechanism derived.\nAssess what was genuinely extended, which draft statements need amendment, and how this relates to the unchanged native receiver-identification gap. Mathematical conditional success must not be treated as actual accessible-state derivation. Declared open premises are limitations unless contradicted in a specific claim. No scientific enumeration or simulation occurred.\nReturn JSON: verdict ACCEPTED, REVISE or FAIL; findings, missing_assumptions, counterexamples, limitations arrays; native_bridge_status DERIVED_FROM_SOURCES or NOT_DERIVED; constructive_analysis array; next_native_obligation string. ACCEPTED requires first three arrays empty. Previous reviews do not certify this argument."
