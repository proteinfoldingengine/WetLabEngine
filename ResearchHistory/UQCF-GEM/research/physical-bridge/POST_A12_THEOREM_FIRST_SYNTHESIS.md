# Post-A12 theorem-first synthesis — current continuation index

Updated: 2026-10-06 (America/Phoenix).
Status: FIXED-RESIDUAL X2 HANDOVER ITEM ANALYTICALLY COMPLETE; BROADER SCHEDULING QUESTION OPEN.
Branch: research/uqcf-overlapping-guard-exchange.

The original proposal, its publication history and precise B1/B2 questions remain immutable at commit 963ad536d9f110e7fe51b443e90c1f8afc461096, blob 29f61b20b72665e3972abdae49b5020eb5547c17. This file now points to the approved follow-on work; it does not retroactively change that proposal or the closed A12 sources.

## Completed work and authoritative records

The user approved studying A11.X2's six-move handover, the information it needs, its repeatability, and BOTH protected-band bounds.

- [Whole-argument audit and scoped closeout](https://github.com/proteinfoldingengine/WetLabEngine/blob/ef317a97b72a869bd3c6ceb38a1bc8bb65375090/ResearchHistory/UQCF-GEM/research/physical-bridge/POST_A12_HANDOVER_CLOSEOUT.md).

The exact new identity is T0=T1=T2, T3=T0 union T6, T4=T5=T6 for the actual transversal families along the prepared handover. Thus its hitting numbers are (a,a,a,min(a,b),b,b,b). Both prepared endpoints being in 3<=tau<=4 is necessary and sufficient for this entire macro to be band-safe.

A Boolean table F_R derived from the FIXED residual roots, plus declared carrier/anchor/target/phase information, suffices to decide and update this policy without repeated access to individual residual supports. It has at most binomial(k,2) residual bits and is demonstrably non-injective on a fixed carrier; initialization can still require global information. This is not a theorem that global W/C alone determines an arbitrary repair policy.

Complete safe handovers connect exactly the ordered anchor pairs in the same component of the graph derived from F_R. A decreasing integer rank proves termination. If a three-label set hits all residual roots, the graph is connected and any two protected prepared states can be joined in at most six handovers (36 incidence edits). The bound is analytical, not a measured performance claim.

The result also supplies valid exact-four endpoints whose macro graph is disconnected. A different native path joins them, so this refutes universal sufficiency of the prescribed handover policy, not X2 or general native repair.

## Next unresolved obligation

The full B1/B2 program is NOT closed. Preparation, residual-root modifications, arbitrary full endpoint restoration and factoring X2's upper-layer conversion through a retained description remain outside the completed item.

The next mathematical task is to specify a broader permitted operation and an information record whose legality, updateability and termination can be proved without an undeclared full-state read. In particular F_R is not asserted updateable when R changes. A counterexample for one narrow macro must not be converted into a claim that all retained-input policies fail.

No next extension, new numerical universe or implementation is launched by this continuation update. Any needed computation requires its own prospectively stated domain, reference calculation, rejecting controls and GitHub execution scope.

## Evidence and unchanged boundaries

This item is written mathematics with author-side argument/reporting audit and immutable readback, not independent peer review, formal proof-assistant certification, numerical PASS or numbered v16 certification. No outside AI was polled or dispatched and no scientific computation was executed for it.

A12.1-A12.5 remains closed at bbc6e6f68beaf7d2d1641e711b46b55ae0bf62db; issue #104, accepted A11 sources and certified v16.54/v16.55 remain untouched. No A12.6 is opened. No physical force, geometry, energy, GR/ADM, dark-matter replacement, physical nonlocality, continuum, observer field or fundamental-time claim follows from the handover result.
